<Steps>

### Overview

Cult Components are designed specifically for **React** and developed using **TypeScript**. They utilize **tailwindcss** for styling and **framer-motion** along with CSS for animations. While Cult Components seamlessly integrate with the shadcn ecosystem, shadcn is not mandatory for their use, though some examples may include shadcn components.

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest clsx tailwind-merge framer-motion
```

Next, integrate our utility function by adding the following code to your project:

```typescript
// lib/utils.ts
import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

### Component Installation

You're ready to go! Visit any [component](/components) page and follow the provided instructions.

Just copy and paste the components you needâ€”no unnecessary bloat or third-party dependencies.
